Dominoes test

This is the initial version of the Dominoes test. I have reworked a Mojo framework to create the game environment, and created the initial gameplay. 
Because the test is limited to 2 hours, the gameplay is not complete. Users can choose a number of players and a board is created, the users are given seven dominoes, which are saved in the database in a separate table. The users can then choose a domino and choose one from the baord to take a turn.
If given further time, the gameplay could be completed.
